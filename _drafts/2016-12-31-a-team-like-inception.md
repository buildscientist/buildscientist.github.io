### When you think of a technical team - what are some metaphors that come to mind? 

A work colleague of mine mentioned how they saw everyone on a team as family. I nodded and acknowledged his statement but the comparison really bothered me. It irked me enough that I spent 3 weeks thinking about how a technical team can be equated to a family. 

My main problem with the metaphor is that everyone has a perspective on what a family consists of. For all I know there may be a single individual out there that consider their own singular self a family. Then I started to think of both positive and negative adjectives associated to the word family like: 

Positive: 
- Loving
- Caring
- Trustworthy

Negative: 
- Dysfunctional 
- Backstabbing
- Conniving

There's nothing in either of those sets of adjectives, perhaps with the exception of trustworthy that I'd want in a team. Then I started to think - well what's a concerete example of a *good* team?

Hollywood has presented us with a gamut of fictional teams but the one that most resembles a software development team to me is that of Christoper Nolan's 2010 summer blockbuster Inception. 

If you haven't seen Inception then do yourself a favor and rent the movie, otherwise you've been forewarned that this post may or may not touch on various thematic elements that may be deemed *spoilers*

In short the film is about a fictional world in which information can be extracted or inserted via dreams. The specifics of how this is done isn't really delved into - but beyond the myriad of comparisons to software development (e.g. dreams with dreams operating like a call stack) the makeup of the core Inception team really fascinates me. 

The team is made up of the following : 

- Cobb - The team lead or manager
- Arthur - An old school yet reliable engineer
- Eames - Another engineer - easily the most pragmatic on the team
- Ariadne - A junior engineer, outspoken and concerned for safety of the team
- Yusuf - A specialist providing some sort of hardware or software that acts as a force multiplier
- Mr. Saito - The product manager/stakeholder
- Mal - Cobb's wife and while she isn't exactly on the team, represents time in the form of scope creep or technical debt

Cobb is a complex character. As the team lead he's clearly very experienced in what he does but often times due to the guilt associated to Mal's death puts the entire team at risk of losing their lives. While Cobb is incredibly assertive in nature he has a number of character traits that I think are critical in a software development manager.

- Readily accepts suggestions from his team
- Does NOT micromamage 
- Delegates tasks accordingly 
- Pulls the team together in times of difficulty or strife

Arthur strikes me as one of those old school engineers who basically do everything by the book. He's the type of software developer that firmly believes you can't mix object oriented and functional programming languages into one. 

> Saito: "Inception. Is it possible?

> Arthur: "Of course not."

> Saito: "If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead?"

> Arthur: "Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head. I say to you, don't think about elephants. What are you thinking about?"

> Saito: "Elephants."

He's reliable, trustworthy and also acts as a mentor/teacher to Ariadne. These are all fantastic qualities in a senior engineer. Where Arthur lacks in imagination - he definetely makes up for in reliability. While there is a bit of a rivalry between him and Eames he never lets it affect his judgement or get in the way of team work.

Eames is like an incredibly talented engineer that is just a tad too full of themselves. A bit of a hipster when it comes to software development but also thoroughly pragmatic. Eames is one of those developers who would implement a backend in Node.JS and a frontend in React because all those other development stacks are too boring to deal with. He deals with the rivalry between himself and Arthur in a rather comical (albeit passive aggresive) manner but at the end of the day still respects what Arthur brings to the table. 

> Eames: Arthur? You’re still working with that stick-in-the-mud?

> Cobb: He’s a good point man.

> Eames: The best. But he has no imagination. If you’re going to perform inception, you need imagination.
